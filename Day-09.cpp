// Imagine you're organizing a running event where participants' completion times (in minutes) are recorded. To give recognition to the top performers, you want to find the k-th fastest runner. However, with a large number of participants, you don't want to sort the entire list, just find the specific position you're interested inâ€”say the 3rd or 4th fastest time.

// For example:

// You have a list of times [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15] in minutes, and you want to find the 3rd fastest time. Here, the 3rd fastest time is 7 minutes, indicating the runner who completed the race in 7 minutes stands in 3rd position among the quickest.
// In another scenario, the list of times is [2, 3, 1, 20, 15], and you want the 4th fastest time. Here, the 4th fastest time is 15 minutes.
// Finding the k-th smallest time without fully sorting the list allows for efficient processing, especially when dealing with a large number of runners. This approach helps you quickly determine rankings or specific positions in a list of unordered data, making it practical for real-time event tracking or leaderboards.
